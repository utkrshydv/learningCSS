## gradient button : 

gradient is treated like an image

border-image: linear-gradient(degrees, color) slicevalue; just keep slicevalue = 1

also there's radial gradient too, like a circle


align-items used for vertical axis
justify-content used for horizontal axis
works only when display:flex

button:hover to appply effects when hovering over that button

## flexbox example 1:

flex-wrap : wrap -> allows wrap
flex-shrink: 0/1 -> allows getting smaller
flex-grow: 0/1 -> allows getting bigger

min-wdith & max-width -> limit flex-grow and shrink

to center something -> 
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;

also when we allow wrap and lets's say there are 3 rows with 3 elements eeach 

we use align-content to control the space between the rows

## expanding search bar

input box with type="search"

input:focus{} -> controls what happens when we click on items
input::placeholder{} -> used for placeholder text
input:focus::placeholder{} -> what happens to placeholder on focus

also keeping a transition: all 0.2s ease; in input{} controls both in and out of focus


yt-video-card: 

<body>  ← flex container
  └── <div class="video-preview">  ← flex item
        ├── <div>IMG</div>         ← normal block inside
        └── <div>TEXT</div>        ← normal block inside

flex only affects the direct children


to remove all anchor default styles -> a{
  all: unset
}

box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color;
